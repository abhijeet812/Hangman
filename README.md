# Hangman
This is a basic Hangman game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game picks a random word related to items in a room, and you have to guess the word by clicking on letters. You can make up to 3 wrong guesses. Try to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn!

Click "Play Again" to restart and try a new word.
